1. build a Filter Component - alcohol, dogs - checkboxes and or input boxes for distance
2. if you're dealing with a checkbox onChange or input it's onChange or on filter button click
3. make ajax call to a rails route (eg. /filter_markets) - filter_controller.rb
   the ajax call would pass all the filter data to the controller as params
4. do active record where clause to filter the markets
5. return those filtered markets as json
6. set state of the component on success of ajax to those new filtered markets
   which in turn calls render and displays filtered markets


# Example Ajax Call
let pet_friendly = this.refs.pet_friendly.value => true
let alcohol = this.refs.alcohol.value => false

$.ajax({
  type: 'POST',
  url: '/api/markets',
  data: { filter: true, filter_data: { pet_friendly, alcohol } }
  dataType: "JSON"

})


# Rails Controller
def filter_markets
  Market.all.where(pet_friendly: params[:pet_friendly], crafts: params[:crafts])
end

t.boolean  "pet_friendly"
t.boolean  "crafts"
t.boolean  "alcohol"
t.boolean  "prepared_food"
