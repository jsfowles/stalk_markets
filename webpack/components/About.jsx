		  <div className='container'>
		  	<p className="center container">Given how popular farmers markets have become recently, we were surprised to find how inconvenient it was to find reliable information about farmers markets in Utah. In addition, most markets provided no reliable information about the vendors that participate. StalkMarkets is designed to fix that by providing accurate information about markets, listing them in order of proximity to your current location, showing you the vendors that attend them, and allowing you to star your favorite vendors. You can also find each vendorâ€™s market schedule. StalkMarkets was created to help easily connect people with their closest market and more easily engage with the local food movement.</p>
